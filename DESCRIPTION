Description: An iterative process that optimizes a function by alternately 
    performing restricted optimization over parameter subsets. Instead of joint 
    optimization, it breaks the optimization problem down into simpler 
    sub-problems. This approach can make optimization feasible when joint 
    optimization is too difficult.
