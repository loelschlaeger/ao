Description: Alternating optimization is an iterative procedure that optimizes 
    a function by alternately performing restricted optimization over individual 
    parameter subsets. Instead of tackling joint optimization directly, it 
    breaks the problem down into simpler sub-problems. This approach can make 
    optimization feasible when joint optimization is too difficult.
