The `{ao}` package implements alternating optimization (AO) in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## Why?

AO is an iterative process that optimizes a function by alternately performing restricted optimization over parameter subsets. Instead of joint optimization, it breaks the optimization problem down into simpler sub-problems. This approach can make optimization feasible when joint optimization is too difficult. See the [package vignette](https://loelschlaeger.de/ao/articles/ao.html) for more details.

## How?

You can install the released package version from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ao")
```

Then load the package via `library("ao")` and you should be ready to go. Here is a simple example of alternating minimization of the [Rosenbrock function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function):

```{r, rosenbrock}
rosenbrock <- function(x) (1 - x[1])^2 + (x[2] - x[1]^2)^2
```

The resulting optimization path ...

```{r, rosenbrock_ao_path, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
out <- ao(f = rosenbrock, initial = c(2, 2))
library("ggplot2")
x <- y <- seq(0.9, 2.1, 0.05)
grid <- expand.grid(x, y)
grid$z <- apply(grid, 1, rosenbrock)
ggplot(grid) +
  geom_raster(aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill = z)) +
  geom_contour(aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, z = z), colour = "white", bins = 40) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 90)
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "x",
    y = "y",
    fill = "value",
    title = "Rosenbrock function with AO path"
  ) +
  coord_fixed() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1, 2)) +
  geom_path(
    data = out$details, aes(x = p1, y = p2), linewidth = 1
  )
```

... is obtained as follows:

```{r, ao rosenbrock}
ao(f = rosenbrock, initial = c(2, 2), add_details = TRUE)
```
