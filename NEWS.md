# ao development

* Added information to `stopping_reason` when solving sub-problem fails.

# ao 1.2.0

* Parameter bounds, analytical gradient and Hessian are now supported more generally.

* Argument `add_details = FALSE` can be used to reduce information in the output.

# ao 1.1.1

* In the case of multiple AO processes, the output now contains the additional elements `estimates` and `values` with results for all processes.

# ao 1.1.0

* AO can now be run in multiple (possibly parallel) processes by providing a `list` of values for the `initial`, `partition`, and/or `base_optimizer` parameters, where each combination creates a separate AO process.

# ao 1.0.1

* Removed `update_code` from output. Updates are now accepted regardless whether they improve the function value. In the end, the best solution is returned.

* Added `tolerance_history` argument to compare function value and parameters between more than one iteration.

* Added `hide_warnings` argument to hide warnings during the AO process.

# ao 1.0.0

* Implemented random partitions, parameter bounds, new stopping criteria (iteration limit, time limit, change in function value, change in parameters).

* The `ao()` API did change a lot, please check the documentation.

# ao 0.3.3

* Now using `{cli}` to improve error messages.

# ao 0.3.2

* Fixed #4 (thanks to S. Chib).

# ao 0.3.1

* Added package start up-message.

* Added more details to README file.

* Increased required version of `{optimizeR}` to version 1.0.3.

# ao 0.3.0

* Updated code to the new `{optimizeR}` version 1.0.1.

# ao 0.2.7

* Renamed input `print.level` -> `verbose`.

* In the return value, renamed element `"time"` -> `"seconds"` (time is now always in seconds); the same in the `"sequence"` element. Additionally, added `"value"` column to the `"sequence"` element.

* Added input `f_partition` to optionally specify functions for the partitions.

* Added input `joint_end` to optionally optimize jointly in the end of the AO process.

* Input `iterlim` can be `Inf` now.

* Having empty elements in `partition` is no longer allowed.

* Removed plotting feature for parameter updates during estimation.

* New dependency on `{checkmate}` for input checks.

# ao 0.2.6

* Added package logo and created package website (https://loelschlaeger.de/ao/) with the [`{pkgdown}`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) package. No code changes.

# ao 0.2.5

* Updated code to the new `{optimizeR}` version 0.3.0, which renamed changed some input and output names.

* In particular, in `ao()`, renamed input `optimizer` -> `base_optimizer`.

* Fixed bug when using numerical gradient and/or Hessian in target function.

# ao 0.2.4

* Updated code to the new `{optimizeR}` version 0.2.0, which renamed some functions.

# ao 0.2.3

* Fixed bugs when having `...` arguments for `ao()`.

# ao 0.2.2

* Removed the `set_f()` interface. The optimization problem is now specified directly in `ao()`.

* The output format of `ao()` has been changed, see the documentation of `ao()`.

* Arbitrary optimizer can now be specified in `ao()` as an `optimizer` object via the framework from the [`{optimizeR}`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=optimizeR) package.

* Removed utils functions from `{ao}`. They are imported from the `{optimizeR}` package.

# ao 0.2.1

* The [Himmelblau's function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himmelblau%27s_function) is included as an example.

# ao 0.2.0

* `ao()` now returns the sequence of estimates in the different iterations as a data frame.

* `ao()` now is able to plot the sequence of estimates during estimation.

* Argument `groups` in `ao()` now is called `partition` and `sequence` is replaced by `iterations`.

* New function `set_f()` for specification of the optimization problem. Parameter constraints can now be imposed on the target function.

* New helper functions `is_number()`, `try_silent()`, `timed()` and `euclidean()`.

* Included a vignette with details on alternating optimization.

* New package sticker.

# ao 0.1.4

* Updated package metadata.

* Updated package sticker.

# ao 0.1.3

* Exported method `print.ao()`.

# ao 0.1.2

* Skip alternation optimization step if a group is empty.

* Estimation times now is returned always in seconds.

* Return `stats::nlm()` outputs.

* Implemented method `print.ao()`.

# ao 0.1.1

* Fixed minor bugs.

# ao 0.1.0

* Initial release.
